After you successfully installed and ran the application, it is time to have a closer look on what is available.

---------------------------

Appearance
----------

Forum manages operations with child objects, special files; handles shortcuts events, toolbar events, ...

Forum application runs from network drive or ClearCase location. Automatically save/load user settings to/from Windows Registry system. 

Build-in Python interpreter
---------------------------

Forum application is completely based on `python programming language <http://www.python.org>`_. The default python interpreter is contained in the form of :ref:`Shell shell` widget. You can use the Shell command window for executing the simple statements. 

Error Logging and Error Report 
------------------------------

Exceptional behavior caused by application itself, by error in expression in Shell, used script in Communicator or other source is logged and error can be reported. Error Report Form consist of problem description which should be filled by user and log files containing content of *forum_[PID].log* file, versions of used modules and environment variables. By pressing the :guilabel:`&Generate to clipboard` all the text is generated into the clipboard and can be sent to specified email address.

Following example shows a result of writing the :py:obj:`test` expression into the Shell. If test object is not defined, such Frame is shown. You can click to :guilabel:`&Send report` if You believe the bug should be fixed in the FORUM application itself.

Logging Facility 
----------------

Logging module (see Python's `logging module <http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/logging.html>`_) from default python distribution is used in Forum application as well. Four loggers are introduced: *root, fapp, script, raw*.

* ``Root logger``: if any 3th party module is using logging module as well than output will be redirected to Forum's Logging Protocol GUI and log file as well.
* ``Fapp logger``: is internal logger informing the user about what the application is doing, for instance how long the script ran, which arguments are passed to VISA device instance, showing syntax error traceback, etc. The output of the logger is the log file and Logging Protocol GUI.
* ``Script logger``: can be used in script itself, printing the output to the current stdout, which is normally Protocol Trace output or Shell.
* ``Raw logger``: is an internal logger.

How to use a logger, change logging level 
=========================================

When developing a script in :ref:`Communicator communicator`, you want to see intermediate logging outputs which may also be present in final version of your script. Using **print** statements is not an elegant solution and also requires to delete or comment out the statements after you finish debugging your code. With loggers you can just set the logging level in accordance to your current code stage. Use ``script logger`` like this::

 import logging 
 logger = logging.getLogger('script')
 logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG) #logging.INFO after script development is finished
 #script code follows...
 logger.debug('this is a debug message')
 logger.info('this is an information')

You may also want to change the logging level of ``root logger`` or ``fapp logger`` in order to increase/decrease information verbosity::

 logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.CRITICAL)
 logging.getLogger('fapp').setLevel(logging.CRITICAL)

Tip: When you start *forum.exe --level=DEBUG* the logging level for both about mentioned loggers is set to DEBUG. DEBUG level is however recommended to application's development purposes only.

The relation between used loggers, handlers and formaters is shown in following figure.

Accessing internal objects on runtime 
-------------------------------------

:ref:`Communicator's Commands Editor editor´ and Shell work with the same namespace. That means anything what is defined in Editor and passed to Interpreter (with Run button) is also accessible in Shell, and vice versa. In the same **globals** is stored special variable pointing to FORUM Application's internal objects. The variable's name is ``_int``.

The idea behind it is to offer FORUM and its sub-application's functionality to the User to fully automate her/his scripts. For example it is possible to use Extractor in scripts itself; make automatic entries of script results in :ref:`Reporter reporter`; initiate own Panel or Frames for user interaction ; choosing visible sub-application in Notebook through code in :ref:`startup.py startup` file; etc.

Type **_int.** in Editor or Console to activate AutoComplete Help which leads you further...

Next Figure maps part of hierarchical distributions of internal objects. For complete map, source code needs to be analyzed by User her/himself. List below the Figure shows probably the most wanted objects to access. Short usage examples are included.

Most of the internal function calls or object accesses which are in general interest are exported into the :ref:`Forum Library forum_library`.
